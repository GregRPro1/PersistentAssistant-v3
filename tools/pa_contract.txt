# PA Script Contract (v1)
# 1) No inline "if(...)" or "try{...}" inside expressions; use full statement blocks.
# 2) Do not use "$pid" as an iterator variable (use $procId).
# 3) Write files via here-strings and UTF-8 (no BOM). No brittle quote-escaping.
# 4) Always print: PACK: <path> and STATUS: <short summary>.
# 5) Echo Script ID at top and bottom.
# 6) Idempotent: safe to re-run; never block on interactive prompts.
# 7) Use explicit parameters (-LiteralPath, no ambiguous -f, etc.).
# 8) For endpoints/UI work, run tests\ui_wiretest.ps1 and include its PACK.
